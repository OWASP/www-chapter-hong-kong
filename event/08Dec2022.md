| Real Case Study of Ransomware Incident Response | When dealing with incidents, one of the tasks is to contain, stopping it from running / speading / regenerating. However, when you think you have hunted down the source, actually it can still respawn. We are going to share some interesting cases when we deal with different incidents. |
| Technical Aspects of Supply Chain Attack by Examples | In this session we will walk through a few examples of supply chain attack vectors, from typical open source bugs (illustrated with insecure deserialization) to binary code cave to corner case of backdoored compiler, and deep dive into the technical details of how the exploits can be executed, all resulting in RCE. |
| Winning Bug Bounty by Exploiting Smart Contract and Blockchain | DeFi, NFT, Metaverse are the recent heated topics. Every hack on the blockchain can range from a few hundred bucks to half a billion dollar loss. It's no surprise the demand for blockchain security surges. In this talk, I'll talk about how to get into Web3 bug bounty hunting and showcase few bugs we found that easily add up to $200k+ bounty rewards. |
| The need for Threat Modeling and Cloud SOC | Threat modeling is an effective way to identify security risks and evaluate whether there are sufficient controls in place to properly manage those risks. With an attacker-centric threat modeling approach utilizing frameworks such as MITRE ATT&CK, it provides threat modelers an attacker’s lens to better understand risks under real-life attack scenarios so that they can go a step further to design attack specific threat detection/hunting logics and deploy queries/dashboards in SIEM. Security Operations Center (SOC) is to monitor, detect, investigation and do incident response for the organization. SIEM is one of the important tools to faciliate the SOC to perform the tasks. SIEM on Amazon OpenSearch Service is a solution for collecting multiple types of logs from multiple AWS accounts, correlating and visualizing the logs to help investigate security incidents. Our team will demonstration the cloud SOC by using AWS Opensearch + Page Duty and Slack. |
